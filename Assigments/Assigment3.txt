How to convert our code to older version of browser-  polyfill
    Like example of map function. suppose map doesn't work in some browser then we can create our own map fucntion.
Babel -- babel plugin transform remove console. 
Diffing Algorihtm-- Hota ye hai ki agar list mey liek ul-li wala agar new li add karoge to react append karta hai last mey, 
                    sean ye hai ki agar last mey add kiye toh thik but first mey add kiya toh , then react ko re render karna
                    padega sab, bas isilye hme key dena hai like <li key="22"> ListValue </li>
JSX-- Its not HTML inside JavaScript, <h1> in jsx is not html but a html like syntax
HTMLvsJSX-- wahi init caps and all
JSX execution- how does jsx execute? Babel understands the JSX code
babel-- babeljs.io == pura normal JSX ko convert karta hai 
functionalComponent is a normal fucntion which returns either a JSX or a react element (which in turns is actually a jS)
XSS attack- cross site scripting attach, if i'm able to run a JavaScript inside your code i can run anything, but this doesn't work with 
            jsx, bascially pahle check karta hai aur sanitize karta hai toh issue nahi hoga
Component Composition- Component inside a component is a component Composition
Is the component hoisted- behaves excalty as a JavaScript component
{{ }}  this is a JavaScript object
